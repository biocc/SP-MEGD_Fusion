# SP-MEGD_Fusion

Mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing remains challenging due to unexpected missing of certain ion information. We developed an innovative sample preparation approach for the current de novo sequencing challenges. The methodology, referred to as SP-MEGD for Single-Pot and Multi-Enzymatic Gradient Digestion, capitalizes on a five-protease gradient digestion by sampling every two hours for a total of 6 hours in an integrative reactor. The SP-MEGD method could engender numerous missed cleavage events and produce various peptide products of diverse lengths with overlapping stretches of residues, enabling efficient database-free de novo sequencing.

Fusion is an assembly software tool developed by Yu Lab, which can precisely reconstruct monoclonal antibody sequences with approximately 100% accuracy, including isoleucine/leucine (I/L) differentiation. Notably, Fusion has demonstrated its capability in precisely sequencing monoclonal antibody mixture at a resolution comparable to that of single monoclonal antibody. The assembly analysis can be finished on the XA-Novo platform (https://xa-novo.com/).
